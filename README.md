# Project Title: AR Tower Defense Game

## Introduction
This project is about creating a Tower Defense game using Augmented Reality (AR) on the Unity platform.

## Description
The AR Tower Defense game is a strategy game where players can place virtual defensive turrets in the real environment using AR technology. The primary goal is to stop the enemies from reaching a specific point on the map by strategic placement and upgrading of these turrets. The game utilizes Unity's AR Foundation and incorporates core game mechanics of a traditional "Tower Defense" game into an immersive AR experience.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
- Unity Game Engine
- AR-Compatible Device

### Installing
- Open Unity Hub and click on the Add button.
- Locate the project folder and click Open.
- Double click the project to open it in the Unity Editor.
- To build and run the project, navigate to File > Build Settings > Build And Run.

## Using the Application
You can place virtual turrets in real-world environments by pointing your device's camera at a surface and selecting a turret type from the user interface. Your placed turrets will then defend against waves of incoming enemies, and you must manage your resources and turret upgrades to survive as long as possible.
